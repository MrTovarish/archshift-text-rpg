# archshift-text-rpg
Text-Based RPG set in the Archshift universe - personal project to learn OOP in Python

To play the game on a system with Python and Numpy installed, download the two files classes.py and textrpg.py and run textrpg.py

To play the game on any other Windows system, download the folder "textrpg" and run the executable found inside.

This project was created from scratch using a small pokemon battler as an outline for the combat.  This is my first project using OOP.
